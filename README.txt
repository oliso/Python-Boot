Python Boot Camp was project I completed with Mechanic Europe as part of their candidate selection process. 

I was tasked to create a simple script which can reverse/uppercase strings in files. It is a simple program, however, the general aim was to ensure my scripts can be called from the command prompt, are well styled (PEP8), modular, unit-tested (pytest), linted (pylint), documented (sphinx), and wrapped into a reusable python package. During the process, I tried to follow the GitFlow workflow framework for version control.
